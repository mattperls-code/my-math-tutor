## Mission

Math is a life long skill. It drives our society into the future and allows the incredible technology we have to exist. Every year, there are more and more jobs that require math. Because of this, having a good foundation in math at a young age is very important. Despite its importance, math is commonly viewed as one of the harder academic subjects.  

With My Math Tutor, students now have access to high quality math content to help them get ahead of the curve.

## Tutorials

My Math Tutor offers 10+ custom math tutorials, and we are planning on releasing many more. These tutorials introduce the topic in a digestable way that helps students understand what they are learning. Additionally, each tutorials has sample problems, where we walk students through every step of the solving process. From there they can go to our worksheets to practice for themself.

## Worksheets

We have over 20+ worksheets and over 200 practice problems in total. With our worksheets, students can test what they have learned for themself, and if they are unsure of their answers, they can use the answer key to check. Our worksheets are also great for teachers. With our download feature, teachers can download worksheets and answer keys to use in the classroom.

## Calculator

Sometimes math can be really tough. Every student should try their best, but when they come across a problem they just can't crack, our calculator can help. Our calculator is equipped to solve a large variety of problems, so when they get stuck we are able to help them find the answer they need.

## Accessibility

We want our website to be available to as many people as possible. Our website supports mobile browsers, so that all the content of the website can be viewed from any device. We also have integrated translations for static content, that allow users to read in English, Spanish, French, and German. Currently, our tutorials, worksheets, search bars, and calculator output do not have translation support. We hope to add support in the future, but translating is a very tedious proccess.
